Joe is a PhD Candidate in the Sundaresan Lab.  He currently has three areas of interest while working in the rice microbiome project.

## Detailing the structure and the factors affecting the structure of the rice root-associated microbiome.
### Root Compartments

Roots inherently change the microbial ecology in the rhizosphere (the soil immediately adjacent to the roots) by acting as a source of reduced carbon through secretion of root exudates and by being a lignocellulosic matrix -  a wonderfully yummy reduced carbon structure for microbes.  Some of microbes in the soil make it into the root (the endosphere).  For penetrance to occur, the microbes must pass the rhizoplane, the root surface.  I am interested in detailing the similarities and differences in these three compartments (see picture).  The rhizoplane, while a very interesting compartment, remains the least studied compared to the rhizosphere and the endosphere.  The rhizoplane's role in regulating penetrance of microbes into the endopshere is an interesting question.

### Rice Genotype
Rice serves as a staple crop for a large portion of the world's population.  Rice cultivars vary for many agronomic important traits, both biotic and abiotic. Many traits for rice production have been exploited through selective breeding.  I'm a believer that the root-associated microbiome contains a plethora of important traits for rice health and yield that may be exploited through breeding.  First, we must find if rice cultivars host different microbiomes.  

### Soil Types

Ultimately, soil is the largest source of microbes for the root microbiome.  If two paddies that are cultivating rice have drastically different soil microbiomes, are the root associated microbiomes also different?  Encompassed in this question are several other related questions: 

-	How does geography affect the soil and root associated microbiomes?
-	How does cultivation practice affect the soil and root associated microbiomes?

Fortunately for me, UC Davis is in the heart of rice country.  I have access to many rice fields through the Central Valley, all practicing different cultivation techniques.

## Root microbiome acquisition

### Microbiome acquisition from the soil
Soil hosts a very large diversity of microbes, thus serving as the main innoculation source for the root associated microbiome.  How the root-associated microbiome establishes itself over time is an interesting question.  Are there certain microbes that come in first and eventually die off? Does everything colonize the roots all at once? 

Even more interesting is the question about how different treatments will change the microbiome and if these changes are consistent across different soils. For instance:

-	How does the microbiome change when plants are exposed to drought conditions? 
-	How does the microbiome change when plants are induced into systemic acquired resistance?
-	How does the microbiome change with different levels of nutrients applied to plants?

### Microbiome Inheritance
Human infants acquire their microbiomes from many different sources.  One interesting microbiome source is via the baby's mother. Is it the same in plants?  I have pretty solid evidence that surface sterilizing a dehusked seed removes all of the bacteria. 



Another area of interest for me is how a plant acquires it's root microbiome.  One would think that a plant would like to acquire and maintain its microbiome as soon as possible, but does it really happen this way?
